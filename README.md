## Overview
This is a project to use IMDd data from a Kaggle dataset to determine if there is any correlation between the runtime of a movie and it's rating on IMDb.
This will provide data to determine what the "ideal" runtime for a movie in a certain genre is.

## Data Files and Data Used
1. imdb_data: File contains the imdb-movies-dataset.csv which has the raw movie data for the project.
2. imdb_top1k: File contains the imdb_clean.csv which has the top 1,000 movies from IMDb.
