# golden-movie-ratio
This is a project to use IMDd data from a Kaggle dataset to determine if there is any correlation between the runtime of a movie and it's rating on IMDb.
I will also be looking to add a datasets from streaming services to see if viewers of each service have a preferance in genre of the movies they watch.
